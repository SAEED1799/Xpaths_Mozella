# Mozilla Forum Scraper

## Overview

This project contains a Python script `xpaths_isDone.py` and a JSON file `xpaths.json` used to scrape specific elements from the Mozilla Support Forum for Firefox. The script fetches the HTML content of the forum page, applies XPath expressions to locate elements, and outputs the count of elements found for each XPath query.

## Files

### xpaths.json

This JSON file contains a list of XPath expressions along with descriptions of what each expression is intended to find. Below is a brief description of the content:

- **Get Help**:
  - **xpath**: `//a[text()='Get Help']`
  - **description**: Find the 'Get Help' link

- **Search Support**:
  - **xpath**: `//input[@placeholder='Search Support']`
  - **description**: Find the 'Search Support' input field

- **First Question**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[position() =1]`
  - **description**: Find the first question article

- **First Five Questions**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[position() <= 5]`
  - **description**: Find the first 5 question articles

- **First Question Username**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[position() =1]//p[@class='user-meta-asked-by']/text()[2]`
  - **description**: Find the username of the person who asked the first question

- **Solved Articles**:
  - **xpath**: `//*[@id='questions-list']/section/article[.//li[@class='thread-solved']]`
  - **description**: Find articles that are marked as solved

- **Asked Yesterday**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[.//p[@class='user-meta-asked-by']/text()[2][contains(., '1 day ago')]]`
  - **description**: Find articles with questions asked '1 day ago'

- **Questions with Marks**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[.//h2[@class='forum--question-item-heading']//*[contains(text(),'?')]]`
  - **description**: Find articles with question marks in the title

- **Usernames Start with D**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[.//p[@class='user-meta-asked-by']//strong[starts-with(translate(.//a/text(), 'd', 'D'), 'D')]]`
  - **description**: Find articles asked by users whose names start with 'D'

- **Two or More Replies**:
  - **xpath**: `//*[@id='questions-list']/section/article[.//span[@class='forum--meta-val'][number(.) >= 2] and .//span[@class='forum--meta-key'][contains(text(), 'replies')]]`
  - **description**: Find articles with 2 or more replies

- **Titles Start with P**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[.//h2[@class='forum--question-item-heading']//*[starts-with(text(), 'P') or starts-with(text(), 'p')]]`
  - **description**: Find articles with titles starting with 'P' or 'p'

- **Titles Fourteen Words**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[.//h2[@class='forum--question-item-heading']/a[string-length(normalize-space(text())) - string-length(translate(normalize-space(text()), ' ', '')) + 1 >= 14]]`
  - **description**: Find articles with titles having 14 or more words

- **Windows 11 Tag**:
  - **xpath**: `//section[@class='forum--question-list questions']/article[.//li[@class='tag'] and .//*[contains(text(), 'Windows 11')]]`
  - **description**: Find articles tagged with 'Windows 11'

### xpaths_isDone.py

This Python script reads the XPath expressions from `xpaths.json`, fetches the HTML content of the Mozilla Support Forum for Firefox, and applies each XPath to the HTML content to count the number of matching elements. The results are then printed to the console.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `lxml` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install requests lxml
```

### Running the Script

1. Save the JSON content to a file named `xpaths.json`.
2. Save the Python script content to a file named `xpaths_isDone.py`.
3. Execute the Python script:
   ```sh
   python xpaths_isDone.py
   ```

### Script Output

The script will output the count of elements found for each XPath expression along with a description. For example:
```
Get Help (Find the 'Get Help' link): 1 elements found
Search Support (Find the 'Search Support' input field): 1 elements found
First Question (Find the first question article): 1 elements found
First Five Questions (Find the first 5 question articles): 5 elements found
...
```

This output provides a quick way to verify which elements are present on the page and how many instances of each were found.
